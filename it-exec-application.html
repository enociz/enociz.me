<p class="measure lh-copy"><strong>To mhsitexecutive@gmail.com</strong></p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">I am Enoch Abinash Appathurai - a coder, a designer and a student at Melbourne High School. I wish to be a part of the IT Executive so I can further help people all throughout the school in fixing any problems, and so that I can represent the student cohort when discussing IT-related issues and thus bring to them a better experience at MHS.</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">I have had extensive IT experience in both my personal life and in former schools. I have dealt with operating systems such as Windows, OSX and iOS and am well-versed in the ways of the classroom use of IT - especially in the field of presentations where the simplest IT blunder can cause many, many minutes of confusion and panic if not fixed quickly. I have worked with everything from phones, to tablets, to laptops, and desktop computers. I have been using iPads in the educational environment since 2011 and am experienced in using all sorts of applications on it from VPN, to font profiles, to GarageBand, to Restler and have displayed my skills in assisting others, especially when IT support desks are at full queue and additional support is needed. Additionally, I possess the necessary skill of being a quick learner meaning that I can be thrown into situations and either through my own experimentation, my research, or through looking at others, I have found that I&#8217;m able to figure out the best solution.</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">So, as you can see, I bring a lot to the Executive and can definitely change the scene. But not only this, I bring the viewpoints of a newcomer to this school, I bring the voice of my fellow year level mates, their calls at lunch when Compass doesn&#8217;t work to submit their assignments on Learning Tasks before Music the next period, their crying when they are unable to access Kahoot or Big History Project to attempt yet another <em>fun</em> quiz. All this I can bring to the Executive along with the solution to these problems, with experience at more than 6 schools of how they work and how MHS&#8217;s infrastructure and system can be improved to set the benchmark for development in not only Victoria, but the whole world!</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">I also bring to the executive a vast experience in leadership. I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>been in the SRC multiple times at prior schools</li>
<li>been the equivalent of Form Captain at prior schools</li>
<li>advocated for the betterment of school resources and infrastructure, particularly in IT</li>
<li>been captain of debating and public speaking teams</li>
<li>been leader of Maths competition teams</li>
<li>been leader of Science Talent Search teams</li>
<li>been leader in Tournament of Minds competitons</li>
<li>won awards at primary and secondary school for Leadership and Academic achievement</li>
</ul>

<p class="measure lh-copy">Not only that, I have experience programming/coding in markup languages such as HTML and MarkDown, in styling languages like CSS and PostCSS, and in other languages such as Visual Basic, VBS, Batch and JavaScript, just to name a few.</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">So, I hope that you make the right choice and select me, Enoch, as part of the IT Executive.</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">Thank you.</p>
