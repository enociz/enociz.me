## About

Hello, I'm Enoch! I'm a rapid frontend prototyper specialising in heuristics and a student at one of Australia's top schools. I've built many websites throughout the last five years but I'm eager to keep learning. That's why, I'm open for an internship. Have one? [Contact me.](mailto:enoch@enociz.me)
